    <title>E001 Origin Story</title>
    <link>https://archive.org/download/origin-story-complete/Origin%20Story%20%28Complete%29.mp3</link>
    <description>This is the origin story of the podcast; that is how I have come to find myself sitting on the floor of a closet, with an old foam mattress topper wrapped around me, speaking into the ether of a microphone with who knows who on the other end.

In this episode, I share with you how the podcast was born out of a strange calling during an exquisitely challenging time; right in the middle of our collective chaos that was 2020.
